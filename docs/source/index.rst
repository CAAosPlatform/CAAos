Preprocessing Operations (.PPO) file format
===========================================

.. warning:: PPO file format here



        All the operations applied are stored in :attr:`operationsXML`, a :mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree` instance. This function saves all operations stored to a text file. This allows for re-run the analysis on the same file, or apply the same set of operations to different cases.
